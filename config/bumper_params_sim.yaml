# This is the length of the filter buffer, applied to 2D lidar scans when detecting
# closest obstacle. A buffer of *lidar_scanner_filter_size* last measurements is kept
# when sequentially going through the scan. If the maximal value from this buffer is
# smaller than the minimal obstacle distance found in the current scan, the obstacle
# distance is updated. This should filter out solitary false positives in the laser
# scan (at least *lidar_scanner_filter_size* consecutive measurements have to be close
# for an obstacle to be reported). For more details, see code (method
# *find_obstacles_in_horizontal_sectors_robust*).
